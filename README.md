# Not Space Invaders

A game inspired from Space Invaders fully coded in Java. The game is divided in four phases :

* Phase 1 : Waves of five invaders pop from the top left corner.
* Phase 2 : Waves of five invaders pop from both the left and right top corners. Invaders move faster.
* Phase 3 : Waves of five invaders pop from both the left and right top corners. Vertical waves of three invaders pop at random positions. Invaders move even faster.
